# Project 2 - Modern Apartment

**Google VR Version: gvr-unity-sdk-1.0.3**

## Project Challenges

Understanding lights and materials is challenging and I still am not 100% familiar with how textures work and how to make them so they tile around an object. I attempted this with a wood texture but was unsuccesful. I will research this further and will apply it to future projects.
The animation scripting section challenged me as well as I don't have a background on game development, I had to start thinking in terms of states, loops, etc. I had a lot of trial and error during this part, but I was successful after thinking about every piece very carefully.

## Overall Thoughts and Learnings

I am a lot more comfortable creating scenes from scratch, including placing objects, creating folders, creating animations and triggering such animations, as well as applying optimization settings to my app. There were a lot of unfamiliar concepts that I am starting to understand, and I am not able to put it all together and create scenes of my own.
