# Intro to VR

## Things I liked

- I enjoyed getting started with VR and seeing how all the pieces start fitting together to create fun VR experiences. I am excited to work through more projects and get a bit more technical with customizations.

## Things That Challenged Me

- XCode's quirks with the provisioning profiles. I need to learn a bit more about Xcode and how the different build settings work.

- I am a Unity novice, so I am still getting used to moving around in the scenes, and trying to find a flow that suits me.
