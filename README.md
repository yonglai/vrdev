# VR Nanodegree

I developed the projects in this repo as part of Udacity's VR Nanodegree.



## Project 1 - Intro to VR
Project 1 covers the foundations of VR development such as optics, displays, tracking, stereopsis and the process of building and deploying VR apps. 



## Project 2 - Apartment
Project 2 covers game objects, transforms, materials and textures, lights, animations and cameras. 



## Projects 3-5
TBD
